        <p>
          A system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the
          operating system it is executed on. In other words, a system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.
          A computer program makes a system call when it makes a request to the operating system’s kernel. System call
          provides the services of the operating system to the user programs via Application Program Interface(API). It
          provides an interface between a process and operating system to allow user-level processes to request services
          of the operating system. System calls are the only entry points into the kernel system. All programs needing
          resources must use system calls
        </p>

        <p><br>
        <h3>1. create()</h3> This system call is used to create a new file. It creates a new file on disk,
        <br />
        creates a file table entry, then sets the first unused file descriptor to point to the table file
        <br />
        entry and then return it (or -1 upon failure)
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>2. open()</h3> This system call can be used to open a file, for either reading or writing
        <br />
        purposes. The working principle in the OS is similar to that of create() , except for the
        <br />
        first step. Instead of creating a file on the disk , it first reads the file from the disk
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>3. close()</h3> This system call takes in a file descriptor (The ones created by the above two
        <br />
        commands) and then closes the file which is pointed at by this file descriptor.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>4. read()</h3> This system call reads a certain number of bytes (passed as parameters) into
        <br />
        the ‘buf’ memory area. It updates the access time for the file as well.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>5. write()</h3> This system call takes a file descriptor and a buffer and writes a certain number
        <br />
        of bytes ( all 3 passed as parameters ) to the file associated with this file descriptor.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>6. lseek()</h3> This system call is used to shift the location of the pointer of a file descriptor.
        <br />
        This location can be set in either relative terms or absolute terms.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>7. dup()</h3> This system call creates a copy of the file descriptor passed to it. This copy is
        <br />
        exactly the same as the original. Both of them can be used interchangeably.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>8. link()</h3> This system call creates a new directory entry for an existing file.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>9. unlink()</h3> As the name suggests, this system does the opposite of what link() does. It
        <br />
        simply removes the directory entry for an existing file
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>10. access()</h3> This system call checks whether or not the calling process can access a
        <br />
        specific file or not (Passed to the call by as a parameter)
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>11. chmod()</h3> This system call is used to change the file’s mode bits (These are the bits
        <br />
        which specify the access control for the file Who can do what kind of changes to the
        <br />
        file) It takes in the path of the file whose permissions we want to change
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>12. chown()</h3> This system call is used to change the owner and/or the group of the file
        <br />
        (passed through a path or a file descriptor). Only a privileged process can change the
        <br />
        ownership of a file.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>13. unmask()</h3> This system call sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask)
        <br />
        to mask & 0777. Basically, it helps us to define the default protection/access modes for
        <br />
        any new files that we create.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>14. ioctl()</h3> This system call manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files.
        <br />
        For example, in Linux, many characteristics of character special files (The terminal is
        <br />
        one such entity), can be controlled using requests made through this system call.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>15. execl()</h3> This system call is used to launch/execute a program/file. It works by overriding
        <br />
        the current process image with one of that which is launched.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>16. fork()</h3> This command is used for making child processes that run parallely along with
        <br />
        the process that created them. After a new process is created, both processes execute
        <br />
        the next instruction following the fork system call.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>17. wait()</h3> This system call blocks the parent process until one of its child processes exits,
        <br />
        or an exit signal is received. After the child process terminates, the parent can continue
        <br />
        with its own execution.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>18. exit()</h3> This system call is used to terminate a process normally. When this system call is
        <br />
        made. Any file descriptors related to the file in questions are closed and the Children of
        <br />
        this process are inherited by process 1 , init.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>19. chdir()</h3> This system call is used to change the current working directory.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>20. alarm()</h3> This system call causes the program to generate a SIGALRM signal for the
        <br />
        process after a certain number of seconds have elapsed.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>21. kill()</h3> This command kills the process group of the caller
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>22. signal()</h3> This system call installs a new signal handler for the signal with number
        <br />
        signum.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>23. getppid()</h3> This system call returns the process ID (PID) of the parent of the calling
        <br />
        process.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>24. getpid()</h3> This system call returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>25. getgid()</h3> This system call returns the real Group ID of the current process.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>26. geteuid()</h3> This system call returns the effective user ID of the current process.
        <br />
        <br>
        <h3>27. getuid()</h3> This system call return the REAL user ID of the current process
